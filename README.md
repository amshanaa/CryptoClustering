# CryptoClustering
Module 19-Challenge


In this particular challenge I utlized the Elbow Curve and K-Means in order to plot and visualize the data.



The Elbow Curve gave visual aid in order to properly assess the correct K-Mean value to utilize for the dataset.

Once the appropriate K-Value was determined, the clusters were graphed.

After that, the dataset was further optimized via Principal Component Analysis.  PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is instrumental in optimization because it reduces that time to review massive data that may have hundreds of columns and rows into smaller cleaner packets of data.  This also helps by reducing/eliminating outliers to provde cleaner analysis.  Below is an example of that optimization.
